# A very trivial guide to creating your virtual enviroment for running this project locally

Steps:

1. Install Python 3.11 or higher
2. Create a virtual environment under the root folder of this project (`python -m venv .venv`)
3. Activate the environment (`source .venv/bin/activate`)
4. Install poetry (`pip install poetry`)
4. Install the required packages (`peotry install`)
   - If you want to install the development dependencies as well, you can run `poetry install --dev`
   - If you want to install with only testing dependencies, you can run `poetry install --test`
5. Run the project (`python horao/main.py`)

## Note on testing

In order to install the testing dependencies you can run the following command `poetry install --test`.
You can run the tests using the `poetry run pytest` command. This will run the tests in a virtual environment and ensure that the tests are run in a clean environment.

### Coverage
A coverage report can be generated by running `poetry run coverage run -m pytest` and then `poetry run coverage report`. This will show the coverage of the tests.
