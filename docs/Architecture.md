## Reasonably 'static' resources

There are various resources that are relatively static, such as physical devices. These resources are usually created once and then used for a long time. The management of these resources is usually done by a small group of people, and the changes are relatively infrequent.

## Reasonably 'dynamic' resources

There are various resources that are relatively dynamic, such as virtual machines. These resources are usually created and destroyed frequently, and the management of these resources is usually done by a large group of people.
