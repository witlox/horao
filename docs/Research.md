# Research Module Overview

This document provides an overview of the research module in the HORAO project, which contains various validation suites for different aspects of distributed systems.

In order to install the corresponding libraries for research, execute the following:
```bash
poetry install --with research
```


## Research Structure

The `research` folder is organized into several subdirectories, each focusing on a specific research area related to distributed systems:

### 1. Distributed Systems Consistency
This area focuses on testing and validating consistency models in distributed systems:
- Tests network partition tolerance
- Analyzes eventual consistency behaviors
- Validates conflict resolution mechanisms

### 2. DevOps Practices
This area examines deployment patterns and operational practices:
- Tests distributed testing frameworks
- Validates CI/CD pipeline configurations
- Measures deployment reliability metrics

### 3. Security in Multi-Cloud Environments
This area focuses on security aspects across multi-cloud deployments:
- Validates encryption mechanisms
- Tests access control policies
- Analyzes vulnerability detection systems

### 4. Telemetry and Observability
This area examines system observability capabilities:
- Tests distributed tracing implementations
- Measures telemetry overhead
- Validates metrics collection accuracy

### 5. Cloud Resource Management
This area focuses on efficient cloud resource utilization:
- Tests autoscaling mechanisms
- Validates resource allocation strategies
- Measures resource utilization efficiency

## Data Collection

Each research area conducts validation tests that generate datasets stored in the `research/data` directory. These datasets are organized by research area and test type, containing various metrics and measurements from test executions.

The `data_validation.ipynb` Jupyter notebook provides comprehensive statistical validation of these datasets, including:
- Completeness analysis (checking if all tests generate expected data)
- Data quality assessment 
- Statistical tests for anomaly detection
- Correlation analysis between related datasets
- Time series analysis for performance metrics

## Running Validations

The research module provides several ways to run validations:

1. Individual area validations:
   ```python
   # Example for running consistency tests
   python -m research.distributed_systems_consistency.run_validation
   ```

2. All validations at once:
   ```python
   python -m research.run_all_validations
   ```

3. Specific test validations:
   ```python
   python -m research.distributed_systems_consistency.run_validation --test network_partition
   ```

## Integration with HORAO

The research module leverages core HORAO components:

- `horao.conceptual.crdt` - For testing conflict resolution and consistency
- `horao.logical.infrastructure` - For simulating different network topologies
- `horao.persistence.store` - For testing data persistence across distributed systems

## Data Analysis

After running validations, use the `data_validation.ipynb` notebook to analyze generated datasets and identify patterns, anomalies, or areas for improvement in the distributed system design.

The notebook provides:
- Statistical validation of test results
- Visualization of key metrics
- Correlation analysis between different system aspects
- Recommendations for system improvements
