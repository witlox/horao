# Management engine for hybrid multi-cloud environments

There are various cloud based management engines available. These tend to be either very specific to a certain cloud provider, or very generic and complex. The goal of HORAO is to provide a simple, yet powerful, management engine that can be used to manage hybrid multi-cloud environments. One of the key design features is to provide a model-based approach to managing resources, which allows for a high level of abstraction and automation.
