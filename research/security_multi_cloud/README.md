# Research Area: Security in Multi-Cloud Environments

## Overview
This research examines the security mechanisms in HORAO, focusing on authentication, authorization, and secure communication across multi-cloud deployments.

## Research Questions
1. How effective are peer authentication mechanisms using shared secrets?
2. What are the security implications of distributed management systems in multi-cloud environments?
3. How can authentication be strengthened while maintaining operational efficiency?
4. What security patterns are most effective for cross-cloud resource management?

## Methodology
1. Security analysis of the peer authentication implementation
2. Penetration testing of cross-cloud communication channels
3. Evaluation of key management approaches in distributed systems
4. Analysis of attack surface and potential vulnerability scenarios

## Testing Approach
To run the experiments in this research folder:

```bash
# Run the security tests
python test_peer_authentication.py
python test_communication_security.py
python test_authorization_boundaries.py

# Run the validation framework
python run_validation.py
```

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive security assessment of HORAO's authentication mechanisms
- Identification of potential security improvements
- Best practices for securing multi-cloud management systems
- Novel approaches to zero-trust architectures in distributed cloud management

## Relevant HORAO Components
