# Research Area: Distributed Systems Consistency

## Overview
This research focuses on CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types) implementations in HORAO and their effectiveness in managing distributed state across multi-cloud environments.

## Research Questions
1. How effective are LWWMap and LWWRegister implementations in maintaining consistency?
2. What are the practical limitations of Lamport Logical Clocks in production systems?
3. How do clock synchronization challenges affect eventual consistency in multi-cloud deployments?
4. What is the optimal configuration for clock offset in real-world distributed scenarios?

## Methodology
1. Implement controlled experiments with varying network latency
2. Analyze consistency violations under different operational conditions
3. Measure convergence time for state updates across distributed nodes
4. Compare HORAO's CRDT implementation with alternative approaches

## Testing Approach
To run the experiments in this research folder:

```bash
# Run the consistency tests
python test_concurrent_updates.py
python test_network_partition.py
python test_clock_drift.py

# Run the validation framework
python run_validation.py
```

## Expected Outcomes
- Quantitative assessment of HORAO's consistency mechanisms
- Recommendations for optimizing clock configurations
- Identification of edge cases that could lead to consistency problems
- Comparative analysis against other distributed consistency approaches
