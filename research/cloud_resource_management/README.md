# Research Area: Cloud Resource Management

## Overview
This research examines HORAO's model-based approach to cloud resource management across multiple providers and compares it with alternative solutions.

## Research Questions
1. How effective is HORAO's abstraction model for managing resources across different cloud platforms?
2. What are the performance tradeoffs of centralized vs. distributed management approaches?
3. How can resource allocation be optimized in hybrid cloud environments?
4. What scalability limits exist when managing thousands of resources across multiple cloud providers?

## Methodology
1. Benchmark resource provisioning operations across different cloud providers
2. Measure management overhead for varying resource types and quantities
3. Analyze bottlenecks in cross-cloud resource operations
4. Implement and test optimization algorithms for resource allocation

## Testing Approach
To run the experiments in this research folder:

```bash
# Run the benchmark tests
python test_cross_provider_performance.py
python test_scaling_overhead.py
python test_resource_optimization.py

# Run the validation framework
python run_validation.py
```

## Expected Outcomes
- Quantitative comparison of management efficiency across cloud providers
- Identification of scalability bottlenecks
- Development of improved resource allocation algorithms
- Best practices for hybrid cloud resource management
